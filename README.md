## 📜 Day-by-Day Breakdown

### 🧠 **Day 1: Introduction to Neural Networks**  
- **Topics Covered**: Perceptrons, activation functions, forward and backward propagation.  
- **Skills Learned**: Building a simple feedforward neural network.  

#### Example Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Sigmoid activation function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example forward pass
inputs = np.array([0.5, 0.8])
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.6])
bias = 0.1
output = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, weights) + bias)
print(f"Output: {output}")
```

### 🖼️ **Day 5: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
- **Topics Covered**: Convolution layers, pooling, and image classification.  
- **Project**: Building a CNN for MNIST digit classification.  

#### Example Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Building a CNN
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.summary()
```

---

### 🔁 **Day 10: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
- **Topics Covered**: Sequence data, LSTMs, GRUs, and time-series forecasting.  
- **Project**: Predicting stock prices using an LSTM model.  

#### Example Code:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Building an LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(30, 1)),
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

---

### 🪄 **Day 13: Transformers**  
- **Topics Covered**: Self-attention mechanism, transformer architecture, BERT basics.  
- **Project**: Sentiment analysis using Hugging Face Transformers.  

#### Example Code:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Sentiment Analysis using Hugging Face
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("I love learning deep learning!")
print(result)
```
